# Quick Start

  1. **OPTIONAL:** Configure the server port and MongoDB host variables in `.env` and `/src/frontend/src/app/environment.ts` files if necessary.
  2. Check [FontAwesome Icons](./docs/fontawesome-icons.md) to setup FontAwesome for the frontend icons to work.
  3. From the project root, run `npm run build` to build the frontend application.
  4. Run `npm start` to start the service on http://localhost:6002 (if configuration was not changed in step 1).
